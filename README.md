# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development. 

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This ensures that the final product aligns with business goals and user requirements.

The repository includes:
- Overview of requirement types
- Techniques and tools used in requirement gathering
- Case studies and practical examples
- Templates for requirement documentation

This project is useful for software engineers, business analysts, project managers, and students who want to learn or improve their skills in requirement analysis.

**What is Requirement Analysis?**

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages, including design, development, testing, and deployment.

âœ… Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:
Understand what the users and stakeholders need from the system

Clearly define system functionalities and constraints

Avoid ambiguity and miscommunication during development

Ensure the final product aligns with business goals
